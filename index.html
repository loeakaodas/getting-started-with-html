<b>Thinking like a programmer</b>
<p>There are different ways in which to think like a programmer:<br>
  1. Procedural thinking<br>
  2. Abstract thinking<br>
  3. Systems thinking<br>
  4. Technological empathy<br>
  5. Systematic debugging
</p>

<b>Basics of the Web</b>
<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of <b>HTML</b> documents that are linked together by <b>URLs</b> and <b>HTTP</b> across the <b>internet</b>. The Web itself was invented in the early 90's at CERN and now comprises over 30 billion pages. You access the web through a browser, which sends a request across the internet using HTTP to a server; a specialiced computer designed to store websites. The most popular browsers are Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext markup language</em>. An HTML document would contain all the text, markup, refferences, and links to other pages that a browser would intepret to present a complete webpage to an end user.
</p>

<b>Markup</b>
<p>HTML markup consits of tags & elements. A <b>tag</b> is something that can change the behavior of it's contents, for example making it <b>bold</b> or <em>italic</em>. It is important to remember to close all your tags or risk creating problems, there are however void tags that don't need to be closed: ex. the img or br tags. There are many different tags that do different things, you can for example <a href="http://www.udacity.com">link</a> to the Udacity homepage! And many other fun things as well. A complete tag comprises an element.<br>
  A good thing to also remember is how <em>whitespace</em> is treated. All tabs, new lines, or multiple    spaces get transtaled into a single space & that is why you need markup to <b>change</b> things up.
</p>

<b>Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are very literal and logical (usually). They will take all your instructions exactly as they were written, no how they might have been intended. So it's important to follow the correct syntax when coding.
</p>

<b>You can't remember everything!</b>
<p>So don't even try. Knowing how to find the right answer with a google search or documentation is always a wiser approach anyway.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML treats certain elements as inline and other as block. What that means is that inline elements will apear on the <em>same</em> line, while <p>block elements get their own special "box" or block.</p>
